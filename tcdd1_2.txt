Spec 5.1.3.1

Verify the first digit of the pairing code

The first digit must be between 0 and 7. If the digit is between 0 and 3, the code length must be 11 digits (VID_PID flag not set).

If the digit is between 4 and 7, the code length must be 21 digits (VID_PID flag set)

Spec 5.1.3.1 - Table 35

If the pairing code is 11 digits/the VID_PID flag is not set, verify the encoded elements.

Digits 2 through 6 must be between 00000 and 65535 Digits 7 through 10 must be between 0000 and 8191

2.b

Spec 5.1.3.1 - Table 36

If the pairing code is 21 digits/the VID_PID flag is set, verify the encoded elements.

Digits 2 through 6 must be between 00000 and 65535 Digits 7 through 10 must be between 0000 and 8191 Digits 11 through 15 must be between 00000 and 65535 Digits 16 through 20 must be between 00000 and 65535

Spec 5.1.3.1- Check Digit (add in appendix?)

Verify the "check digit" of the pairing code (digit 11 or 21) by entering the preceding digits in to the checksum script/Test Harness

Verify the final digit (11 or 21) of the pairing code printed on the DUT matches the generated digit by the script/Test Harness.
