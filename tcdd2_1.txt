5.2.3-4, 5.2.3-5

if (PICS_BLE)

TH does not respond to DUT and DUT keeps sending ADVs

DUT contains in the ADV:

>12-bit "Discriminator" field

DUT may contain in the ADV:

>16-bit "Vendor ID" field

>16-bit "Product ID" field

Length variable "Extended Data" field

5.2.3-9

if (PICS_BLE)

TH does not respond to DUT and DUT keeps sending ADVs

If (PICS_BLE) the ADV contains a GAP peripheral and uses the GAP General Discoverable mode

5

5.2.3-11

if (PICS_BLE)

TH does not respond to DUT and DUT keeps sending ADVs

Between T0 and 30s, DUT should sends ADVs each 20ms to 60ms

Between 30s and 15min, DUT should sends ADVs each 150ms to 1200ms

6

5.2.3-12

if (PICS_BLE)

TH does not respond to DUT and sends a power cycle command to DUT

DUT restarts the ADV sending process and uses a new address (the previous address must be stored by TH in the previous step).

7

5.2.3-4, 5.2.3-5

if (PICS_BLE)

TH does not respond to DUT and DUT keeps sending ADVs. TH waits at least 15 minutes

DUT stops sending ADV in 15 minutes or less.

5.2.3-15

if (PICS_WIFI)

TH scans and finds the DUT SSID

DUT SSID is not hidden and has the format: CHIP-ddd-vvvv-pppp

9

5.2.3.-16

if (PICS_WIFI)

TH scans and finds the DUT SSID

TH sends to DUT a 1st power cycle command (or reset manually)

TH sends to DUT a 2nd power cycle command (or reset manually)

DUT BSSID is random on each boot. DUT BSSID has the value X

After 1st power cycle, DUT BSSID is random with respect X (is not X, X+1, X-1, X*2, X/2, etc.)

After 2nd power cycle, DUT BSSID is random with respect X (is not X, X+1, X-1, X*2, X/2, etc.)

DUT bcast bit is set.

DUT locally-administered bit is set.

5.2.3-19, 5.2.3-21

if (PICS_WIFI) & (PICS_IE)

TH scans and finds the DUT SSID

DUT IE is carried in the Wi-Fi soft-AP Beacon and Probe response frames

AND

DUT includes in that IE the following fields:

0x00 (Reserved)

0x01 (Device State)

0x02 (Device Information)

0x03 (Rotating Device Id)

0x04 - 0xFF (Reserved)
