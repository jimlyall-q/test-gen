4.2.1 TH

TH is put in Commisisoning Mode and start advertising its availability for commissioning

no desc

DUT

DUT scan for devices that advertise availability for commissioning

DUT must report the following:

- DNS-SD instance name must be 64-bit randomly selected ID expressed as a sixteen-char hex string with capital letters

- service type must be _matterc._udp

- service domain is .local. For Unicast DNS such as used on Thread the service domain SHALL be as configured automatically by the Thread Border Router

- target hostname is the 48bit MAC address expressed as a twelve capital letter hex string. If the MAC is randomized for privacy, the randomized version must be used each time

- subtype _S<dd> 4-bit short discriminator, encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes

- subtype _L<dddd> 12-bit long discriminator, encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes

- subtype _C<d> must have a value of 1

- subtype _A1 must be present

- if optional subtype _V<ddddd> is present must be 16-bit vendor id, encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes

- if optional subtype _T<ddd> is present, <ddd> represents device type from Data Model and must be represented as a variable length decimal number in ASCII without leading zeroes

- key D must be present and represents the discriminator which must be encoded as a variable-lenght decimal value with up to 4 digits omitting any leading zeroes

- if optional VP key is present must contain at least Vendor ID and if Product ID is present, values must be separated by a + sign.

- key AP=1 must be present

- key CM=1 must be present

- if optional DT key is present must contain the device type identifier from Data Model Device Types and must be encoded as a variable length decimal ASCII number without leading zeroes

- if optional DN key is present must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a maximum length of 32B

- if optional key RI is present must include the Rotating Device Identifier encoded as an octet string with a maximum length of 100 chars

- key PI encoded as a valid UTF-8 string with a maximum length of 128 bytes

- optional key PH encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes. If present value must be different of 0

DUT

Rescan devices that advertise availability for commissioning

DUT must report the TH advertise containing:

- DNS-SD instance name must be 64-bit randomly selected ID expressed as a sixteen-char hex string with capital letters and must be different from the one at step 3

- service type must be _matterc._udp

- service domain is .local. For Unicast DNS such as used on Thread the service domain SHALL be as configured automatically by the Thread Border Router

- target hostname is the 48bit MAC address expressed as a twelve capital letter hex string. If the MAC is randomized for privacy, the randomized version must be used each time

- subtype _S<dd> 4-bit short discriminator, encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes

- subtype _L<dddd> 12-bit long discriminator, encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes

- subtype _C<d> must have a value of 0

- subtype _A1 must be present

- if optional subtype _V<ddddd> is present must be 16-bit vendor id, encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes

- if optional subtype _T<ddd> is present, <ddd> represents device type from Data Model and must be represented as a variable length decimal number in ASCII without leading zeroes

- key D must be present and represents the discriminator which must be encoded as a variable-lenght decimal value with up to 4 digits omitting any leading zeroes

- if optional VP key is present must contain at least Vendor ID and if Product ID is present, values must be separated by a + sign.

- key AP=1 must be present

- if key CM is present must have a value of 0

- if optional DT key is present must contain the device type identifier from Data Model Device Types and must be encoded as a variable length decimal ASCII number without leading zeroes

- if optional DN key is present must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a maximum length of 32B

- if optional key RI is present must include the Rotating Device Identifier encoded as an octet string with a maximum length of 100 chars

- key PI encoded as a valid UTF-8 string with a maximum length of 128 bytes

- key PH encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes. If present value must be different of 0

TH

By any means, TH adds an unknown key/value pair in the advertised data(e.g. AB=12345) and is put in Commissioning Mode

TH must contiune to advertise with new data added

6

DUT

Scan for DNS-SD commissioner advertisements from TH

DUT report must be same with the one from step 2 but silently discard the unknown key/value pair added at step 5
